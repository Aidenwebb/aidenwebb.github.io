There are currently over 50,000 free books to choose from on Amazon's Kindle Store. Just add a book to your library using the `Buy now` button (not `Subscribe to Kindle Unlimited / Read for £0.00`) and read with Amazon Cloud reader in a web browser or sync to your Kindle.

The below link will open a filtered search on the Amazon UK website showing ALL the books that are currently FREE to add to your account without needing a Kindle unlimited subscription.

[Click here to go to Amazon][1] or scroll down and scan the QR code at the bottom of the page.

This saves a lot of time scrolling through the Freebies section clicking one free book deal at a time only to find they are no longer free.

I'd suggest saving the link and then filter on your Genre/Requirements.

Happy freebie hunting!
