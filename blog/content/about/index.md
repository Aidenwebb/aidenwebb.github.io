Hi, I'm Aiden Arnkels-Webb - I help professional services firms build secure infrastructure that enables growth, not friction.

I currently lead cybersecurity for a UK alternative network provider, where I spend my days ensuring systems stay secure, compliant, and actually work when people need them. But I also run Rootwire, where I help firms like yours implement the same thinking without needing a full-time CISO or CTO on staff.

What does that actually look like? Think about the last time you wanted to enable remote access for your team. You probably didn't need a lecture about zero-trust architecture - you needed someone who could architect the solution, implement it properly, and explain the business case to your partners without jargon.

Here's what I kept seeing: Brilliant professional services firms - law practices, accountancies, consultancies - hitting the same wall as they grew.

The pattern was always the same. Smart, capable professionals who'd built successful practices suddenly found themselves either:

- Drowning in compliance requirements they didn't fully understand
- OR constantly firefighting IT problems instead of focusing on clients
- OR paying for technology they didn't fully trust or understand
- OR missing growth opportunities because their infrastructure couldn't scale
